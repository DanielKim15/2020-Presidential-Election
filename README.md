# 2020-Presidential-Election Results
The 2020 Presidential Election was definately a night (or should I say week) to remember. Not only did this voting event broke several records from past elections, it also has the most in depth data to this date. I'm going to show you some insights I found in this phenomenon.

## The Data: 
To begin the analysis, I used the New York Times Presidential Election Dataset as my source. To this date they have the most detailed data available to the public, and have informations on all 13 days of the election. For the purpose of simplicity, I will just use the final day of the election, November 16th presidential dataset, and the counties dataset to build the visuals of the election. 

## How my function Works:


## Total Votes (In-person and Absentee combined)
### Entire Nation
From the data it shows that Biden supporters are more likely to do absentee votes than Trump Supporters in election.

We can see in the total popularity votes how strong the candidates recieve votes in each state. We can see how states who have a strong connection to their favored party (democrats or republican) continue to stick with their previous choice in the past.
